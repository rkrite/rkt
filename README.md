## Laravel PHP - Data Conversion
https://vbox.discooctopus.com/ -
A little project I did for an easy way to convert data files for more standardised and common tools usage.

### Install
It is a Laravel 12.2.0 site
- Clone this repo locally.
- That should be all :)
- Open the local site

### Usage
* Select the source type - Currently either raw VBox (.vbo) or DJI Flight Log (.json)
* Select the source file
* Swelect the data format you would like - Currently only GPX
* Click Submit to convert the data file
* The browser will present the file for download

### Planned Updates
* Add the source type for raw DJI datafile (.txt)
* Add the data format output for KML
